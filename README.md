# AutoLicense
Automagically adds, commits, pushes licence files to all your GitHub repos.


Make a new file `toadd.txt` with your new license file. Run main.py. Enter your username. Done!

*Be very careful*. This will clone, add, commit, push to all of your GitHub repositories with a new license. This is massively useful if you've got a lot of currently unlicensed code, and massively dangerous if you've got lots of forks and already licensed code.

I am in no way responsible for any damage this causes.
